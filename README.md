2. All required data is loaded
3. The columns are named by meaningful variable names. To name the columns of the X_test and X_train dataframe, the vector with the feature names are used.
4. Data frames are merged and sorted by subject and activity
5. The numbers of activities in the data frame are replaced by meaningful names
6. The data frame is melted and subsequently casted. Finally, the casted data frame is written as a txt file.
